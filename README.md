## Summary
Obviously the bike sharing program in New York is a hit. It is the perfect combination of public transport to near by location and a lowering your carbon foot print. The majority of Subscribers are male and seem to use it between 6-9am and 4-6pm for what I assume would be commuting to and from work.
