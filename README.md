# Bikesharing Visulization with Tableau

## Overview
The purpose of this project was to analyze bike sharing data obtained from the Citi Bike website (link below). The data presented was collected from the Citi Bike Sharing website and is from the New York City area. The aim was to gain a better understanding of the bike sharing success and the demographic that uses it the most, and to assess whether it could be a profitable business in Iowa.

## Summary
Obviously, the bike sharing program in New York is a hit. It is the perfect combination of public transport to nearby locations and lowering one's carbon footprint. The majority of subscribers are male and seem to use it between 6-9am and 4-6pm, presumably for commuting to and from work.
