# Bikesharing Visulization with Tableau

## Overview
The purpose of this project was to analyze bike sharing data that we got from the Citi Bike Website (link below). The data presented below was collected from the Citi Bike Sharing website and is collected from the New York City area. The hope was to gain a better understanding of the bike sharing success and the demographic that use it the most, and if it is a business that could be profitable in Iowa.

## Summary
Obviously the bike sharing program in New York is a hit. It is the perfect combination of public transport to near by location and a lowering your carbon foot print. The majority of Subscribers are male and seem to use it between 6-9am and 4-6pm for what I assume would be commuting to and from work.
